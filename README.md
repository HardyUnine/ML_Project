## TODO 

Define a scientific question for your project as well as the motivation for that question.
Determine what data you would need to answer the question. Which variables? How could it be collected? Are there example data similar to what you need available online?
Specify how you would model relationships between the different variables. What would you be looking for? Can the problem be cast as classification, regression, or something else?
What potential problems can you imagine might arise when trying to analyse the data?
Answer the above questions, keeping in mind that you most probably will not be able to obtain the necessary data to perform the analysis. The actual project will be based on you simulating data from a generative model that you create. This will allow you to test under which conditions your methodology can and cannot work. 

The question to answer for this assignment about your project are the 4 questions asked above( You will also find it in the second page of the attached pdf). Submit your assignment as a pdf (one assignment per group so only one member will submit the group assignment). Add all group member in the assignment.
